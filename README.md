# Classification of OCT images to diagnose retinal disease
Diagnosis of various retinal diseases from spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images is challenging. Various automated methods such as image processing, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms have been used for the early detection and diagnosis of retinal diseases. Unfortunately, these are prone to error and computational inefficiencies that require further intervention by human experts. In this project, different architectures of neural networks have been implemented and tested in order to make a comparison between them. The implemented networks are MLP, CNN, MobileNet, Xception, and OpticNet. Also, in the end, the effect of augmenting the input data on the output of the network is examined.
